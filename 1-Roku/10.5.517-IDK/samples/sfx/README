This sample channel demonstrates:

+ How to decode a MP3 file into PCM samples.  Then, use Roku's sound effect
  interface to play back music to audio output.

Some notes in no particular order:

+ This sample uses unmodified open source library minimp3; please see
  LICENSE-minimp3 text for more information.  You can learn more about it:

+ For sure this sample only shows that PCM playback works and I am days before
  my deadline.  Generally this interface is for short clips but you can use it
  to play music for hours if you need to.

+ It is also worth noting that through this interface it is possible to control
  maximum audio render delay, useful when you need to control rendering delay
  for synchronization.

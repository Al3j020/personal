This sample channel demonstrates:

+ How to get remote input events.

Some notes:

+ The class RemoteControl is reusable but its implementation is not complicated
  at all.  The idea is that, once you have a context, you can check to see if
  input events are available.  For platforms that support IDK, they will not
  support motion and gaming remotes.

+ Make sure you collect all events.  For example, on single press you'll get
  two events for key down and key up.
